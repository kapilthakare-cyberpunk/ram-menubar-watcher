A lightweight macOS menu bar utility that displays live RAM usage at a glance and lists memory-intensive processes. Designed specifically to support macOS 26+ (Tahoe) via **SwiftBar**.

```text
RAM 68%   ← Appears in your menu bar, updating dynamically every 5 seconds
```

## ✨ Features

- **Live Status bar:** Displays real-time RAM usage percentage.
- **Process List:** Lists the top 5 memory-consuming processes inside a dropdown.
- **Interactive Termination:** Click-to-kill option on any process to terminate memory-hogging tasks instantly.
- **Visual Warnings:** Changes status color based on configurable thresholds (yellow for warning, red for critical).

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Operating System:** macOS 10.15 Catalina or later (Fully supports macOS 26 Tahoe)
- **SwiftBar:** Installed via Homebrew cask: `brew install --cask swiftbar`
- **Python:** Python 3.10+ installed via Homebrew or system installation

## 📥 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:kapilthakare-cyberpunk/ram-menubar-watcher.git
cd ram-menubar-watcher
```

### 2. Run the Installer
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

> [!NOTE]  
> The installer automates the following actions:
> - Cleans up legacy LaunchAgent `.plist` and Application bundle configurations.
> - Verifies and installs SwiftBar via Homebrew Cask if missing.
> - Sets up a project-local virtual environment (`.venv/`) and installs `psutil`.
> - Marks the SwiftBar plugin script `plugins/ram.5s.py` as executable.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 1. Launch SwiftBar
Start SwiftBar from your Applications folder, or execute:
```bash
open -a SwiftBar
```

### 2. Select Plugin Directory
When prompted by SwiftBar, choose the plugins directory inside this repository:
```text
/Users/kapilthakare/Projects/ram-menubar/plugins
```

Alternatively, if you already have a configured SwiftBar plugin directory, you can symlink the plugin:
```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)/plugins/ram.5s.py" "/YOUR/EXISTING/PLUGINS/DIR/ram.5s.py"
```

### 3. Customize Thresholds
To adjust warnings and update speed, edit the configuration constants at the top of [plugins/ram.5s.py](file:///Users/kapilthakare/Projects/ram-menubar/plugins/ram.5s.py):

```python
# Configuration
WARN_THRESHOLD = 60   # % -> yellow warning in menu bar
CRIT_THRESHOLD = 80   # % -> red warning in menu bar
TOP_N          = 5    # number of processes shown
```

> [!TIP]
> To change the refresh interval, simply rename the plugin file to reflect the new timing (e.g., rename to `ram.10s.py` for a 10-second refresh interval).

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

To clean up configurations and legacy files:
```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

To remove SwiftBar:
```bash
brew uninstall --cask swiftbar
```
